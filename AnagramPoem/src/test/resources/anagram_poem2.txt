A long insane warlord,
Insane Golan warlord...
As a lion, Ron wrangled.
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.

Danger! An ill war soon.
Ill war rages on and on,
A long, lean SDI war, Ron.
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.

Ron draws along a line.
A long Ron leads in war,
War alone, darling son.
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.

Ron: a lewd slogan: Iran.
Iran allows no danger,
Allow Iran no gardens.
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.

Regal London saw Iran.
Iran warns gold alone.
Sell a dog now, ran Iran.
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.

No wars: Ron gained all.
Was all Ron gained Ron?
Loa! Ron's law in danger,
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.
