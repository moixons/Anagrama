Anagram Exercise

As specified in Wikipedia, an anagram is a type of word play, the
result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a
new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; e.g.,
orchestra = carthorse, A decimal point = I&#39;m a dot in place.
An anagramic poem is a poem where each line or each verse is an
anagram of all other lines or verses in the poem. Please prepare
Java code that, given a poem, returns a Boolean value indicating
whether or not the poem is an anagramic poem.
Your example should include the following:

- Unit tests
- Argument validation
- Error handling
- Comments as deemed necessary
- Documentation on how to run and test the code
- Any assumptions that you have made
- The exercise should be resolved using objects.

We should be able to run your program as delivered (i.e. without
modifying any code). If any third-party dependencies are required,
you should either (a) include the dependencies with the delivered
solution, or, (b) include a build solution in either Ant or Maven that
will allow us to resolve all required dependencies.
